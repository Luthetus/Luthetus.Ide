    /// If a symbol references a defintion that exists within a different ResourceUri,
    /// and is not "indexed" information, then this disambiguates the definition.
    ///
    /// Example: TypeClauseNodes reference TypeDefinitionNodes.
    /// If the TypeDefinitionNode being referenced exists in a different file,
    /// this is not an issue because all "top level TypeDefinitionNodes"
    /// are maintained in a global list / dictionary.
    ///
    /// But, if a VariableReferenceNode references a VariableDeclarationNode,
    /// and that 'VariableDeclarationNode' is a property of a 'TypeDefinitionNode',
    /// then this is now too much data to fit onto a symbol (without modifying the symbol type itself).
    ///
    /// So, this property allows one to say, "the 0th symbol I instantiated
    /// is a reference to this TextEditorTextSpan (which is in a different file)."
    ///
    /// The 'int' resets per parse of an entire file. And starts at 0
    /// and increments by 1 each symbol instantiated in that file.
    ///
    /// This requires the 'ISymbol' type to be modified.
    /// But, this solution uses minimal memory since it only requires an 'int', and it is more of an "opt-in".
    /// Since this dictionary property isn't required by any ICompilerService implementations.
    ///
    /// But, if a different ICompilerService implementation wanted to map
    /// from a symbol to arbitrary information, they'd be able to do so.

    /// in a chain of member accesses.
    ///
    /// Then, use the cursor position to determine where-in the member access
    /// chain they are hovering.
    ///
    /// And finally, calculate a symbol on demand for that section of the member access chain
    /// instead of pre-calculating it and storing it.

    /// visit each 'ResourceUri' and at this point decide how to go from here.
