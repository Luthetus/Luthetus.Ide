/// This class is an exception to the naming convention, "don't use the word 'Luthetus' in class names".
/// 
/// Reason for this exception: when one first starts interacting with this project,
/// 	this type might be one of the first types they interact with. So, the redundancy of namespace
/// 	and type containing 'Luthetus' feels reasonable here.
