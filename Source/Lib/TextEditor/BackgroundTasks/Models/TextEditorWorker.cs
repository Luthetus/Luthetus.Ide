/// All this instance does is communicate to the 'ITextEditorService'

/// At that point the ITextEditorService dequeues from its own queue
/// (which is more optimized) until it finds a non-match contiguous EventKind.
///
/// At that point there is an IEnumerable<"EventData"> that can
/// be batched.
///
/// After all the dequeues of the same EventKind are handled
/// then return back to the IBackgroundTaskService.
///
/// By doing this the 'IBackgroundTaskService' will
/// have many references to this type in the queue
/// in the sense that,
///
/// 6 events are enqueued,
/// 6 references to the same TextEditorWorker are enqueued
/// All 6 events are batched into a single work item.
/// There are still 5 more references to this TextEditorWorker enqueued
/// Each one when dequeued returns Task.CompletedTask because the previous work item
/// encompassed all 6 events.
///
/// You have to always enqueue a reference to this because you are dequeue batching
/// you don't know if the EventKinds will match when enqueueing.
/// 
/// ???
///
/// The ITextEditorService has a queue foreach of the 'EventData kinds'
/// then one queue that every event queues to that says that something happened
/// and where the event data can be dequeued from.
