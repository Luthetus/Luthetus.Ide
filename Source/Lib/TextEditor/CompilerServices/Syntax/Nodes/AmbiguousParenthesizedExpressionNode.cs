	/// The expression parsing code will "merge" an instance of this type
	/// with whatever 'ISyntaxToken' is next.
	///
	/// But, the first time this "merge" occurs there is some
	/// disambiguation that needs to be done.
	///
	/// Not all of the disambiguation can be done here,
	/// because if it is a ParenthesizedExpressionNode,
	/// this would mean writing code to handle function invocation
	/// within the AmbiguousParenthesizedExpressionNode itself.
	///
	/// We only want to look ahead just enough to determine if this is a
	/// - ParenthesizedExpressionNode
	/// - or should we continue as an AmbiguousParenthesizedExpressionNode
	///
	/// One needs to be able to handle a tuple "literal" not just
	/// a TypeClauseNode which is a tuple.
	///
	/// tuple "literal":
	/// ````(3, "abc")
	/// 
	/// tuple TypeClauseNode:
	/// ````(int, string)
	///
	/// This is something I skipped over in my head when first thinking about this.
	/// I currently am transforming the AmbiguousParenthesizedExpressionNode
	/// to a ParenthesizedExpressionNode if I see a non-nameable-token as
	/// the first entry in the comma separate list.
	///
	/// But, with this current way, I'd have to once again
	/// go from ParenthesizedExpressionNode to AmbiguousParenthesizedExpressionNode
	/// if it turns out there is an un-accounted for comma amongst the inner expression of the ParenthesizedExpressionNode.
	///
	/// This also opens up the idea of maybe having a 'tuple' type that can be used as a TypeClauseNode,
	/// and having a separate type that can be used for a 'tuple literal'?

    ///     (x, y) => 2;
    ///     (int x, bool y) => 2;

    /// -----------------------------------------------
    ///
    /// If we ignore the syntax that follows the CloseParenthesisToken
    /// we can isolate the common cases between the two nodes,
    /// and generally hold their information in this type until disambiguation.

    ///     (x, y)
    ///     (int, bool)
    ///     (int x, bool y)
    ///     (int counter, bool isAvailable)
    ///
    /// -----------------------------------
    ///
    /// I re-ordered the cases by their similarity.
    /// It is important to note that:
    ///     '(x, y)' and '(int, bool)'
    ///     are not equivalent cases.
    ///
    /// '(x, y)' was from the LambdaExpressionNode,
    /// '(int, bool)' was from the TupleExpressionNode.
    ///
    /// '(x, y)' takes both 'x' and 'y' to be the names for a VariableDeclarationNode.
    /// '(int, bool)' takes both 'int' and 'bool' to be TypeClauseNode(s).
    ///
    /// Thus, the solution is to hold comma deliminated "nameable tokens" /
    /// "convertible to IdentifierToken tokens" as just the ISyntaxToken itself until disambiguation.

    /// ````var x = 2;
    /// ````return (double)x;
    ///
    /// The differentiation is because there is only a single nameable token, and there
    /// are no CommaToken(s).
    ///
    /// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///
    /// Now the remaining cases are:
    ///     (int x, bool y)
    ///     (int counter, bool isAvailable)
    ///
    /// This is comma separated list of VariableDeclarationNode(s).
    ///
    /// i.e.: List<IVariableDeclarationNode> _variableDeclarationNodeList;
    ///
    /// Both '_nameableTokenList' and '_variableDeclarationNodeList'
    /// should be nullable, in order to only allocate
    /// one or the other, based on what appears before the first CommaToken.
